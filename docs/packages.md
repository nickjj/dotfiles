All packages listed here are the names of the packages either in the official
Arch package repository or the AUR. The AUR is used sparingly and will be
called out when used. They get installed and configured by default for you by
these dotfiles but you can modify the list.

On Arch Linux with these dotfiles you can run `pkg list` to see a comparable
list of packages you have installed.

*Similar packages exist for Debian and macOS but not all packages below are
installed in these environments.*
